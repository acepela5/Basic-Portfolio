    <p>Hello all, my name is Adi Cepela. I am a graduate of VanderCook College of Music with my Bachelor's Degree in Music Education.
        In school we learned how to teach and play 21 instruments while honing skills on our primary; for me, that was the violin.
        These four years since graduating have been spent teaching middle school orchestra to a diverse community of students.
    </p>
    <p>When I am not teaching, I enjoy exercising, eating, and baking. In my free time, I still perform with the Lakeview Orchestra and play weddings as a trio. 
        My husband, Paul, and I have two cats with lots of personality, Mahler and Elgar.
